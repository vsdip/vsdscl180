# vsdscl180

We are checking the compatibility of scl180 with openroad flow.

## example 
  1. gcd
     - we have chosen a simple example and started analyzing and comparing the outputs with sky130hd gcd example already availiable in the openroad flow.

Tools : ![OpenRoad flow](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts).

## Firstly, we start with synthesis:

we use the OpenRoad tools flow to generate the required synthesized code.(Gate level netlist)

then we use the OpenSTA tool to get details such as timing & power.

we can see the comparision below:
